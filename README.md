- 👋 Hey, I’m Ali; I'm new to the world of coding, well new if you don't count the good old days of Myspace lol. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as many coding languages as possible before I choose what I will be persuing long term, based on which I excel at as well as likability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently at the end of my course learning HTML/CSS and will then be moving on to learning Javascript. After I finish with Javascript, I will be moving on to a course on Front End Development Libraries and will continue on after that with all of other available courses on freeCodeCamp's website. 
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything as I am still in the early learning stages. I will, however, be looking to collaborate on a number of different projects in the future, you know, once I expand my knowledge and skills.
